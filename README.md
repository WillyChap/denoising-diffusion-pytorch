## Conditional Denoising Diffusion Model for Climate Prediction, in Pytorch

This fork adapts the [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) for climate predictions using the CESM2 Large Ensemble (LENS) data. It predicts T2m, Precipitation, and Surface Pressure, conditioned on a given month and CO2 concentration (CO2vmr). This enables climate model forecasts with diffusion-based predictions, improving upon existing methodologies for ensemble predictions.

### Features
- **Conditional**: The model takes CO2vmr and month as inputs.
- **Training scripts for NCAR HPC**: New launch and training scripts tailored for the NCAR High Performance Computing environment.
- **File Structure**: The file tree has been significantly restructured to accommodate the new scripts and features.

For more information about the CESM2 Large Ensemble, visit the [CESM2 LENS page](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/community-projects/lens2).

## Usage

I have provided, launch scripts for PBS scheduling, and wandb implementation, but the user must input their own details. 


```python
model = Unet(
        channels = 3,
        dim = config['hidden_channels'],
        conditional_dimensions=config['context_channels'],
        dim_mults = config['dim_mults'],
        flash_attn = config['flash_attn'],
        dropout = config['dropout'],
        condition = True
    )
    
    diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(
        model,
        image_size = (192, 288),
        timesteps = config["timesteps"],    # number of steps
        auto_normalize = True,
        objective = "pred_v",
     )
    
    
    word_site = "https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000"
    response = requests.get(word_site)
    WORDS = response.content.splitlines()
    
    # Generate random indices
    rn1 = randint(0, len(WORDS) - 1)
    rn2 = randint(0, len(WORDS) - 1)
    
    # Decode the byte lines to strings
    w1 = WORDS[rn1].decode('utf-8')
    w2 = WORDS[rn2].decode('utf-8')
    
    run_name = f'{w1}_{w2}'
    
    print(f'my name is {run_name}')
    
    diffusion.is_ddim_sampling = True
    print('model params:', sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad))
    trainer = Trainer_CESM(
        diffusion,
        '/glade/derecho/scratch/wchapman/CESM_LE2_vars_BSSP370cmip6/',
        config,
        run_name,
        train_batch_size = config["batch_size"],
        results_folder = './results_cc/',
        train_lr = 5e-5,
        train_num_steps = 700000,         # total training steps
        gradient_accumulate_every = 2,    # gradient accumulation steps
        ema_decay = 0.995,                # exponential moving average decay
        amp = True,                       # turn on mixed precision
        calculate_fid = False,           # whether to calculate fid during training
        max_grad_norm = 1.0,
        save_and_sample_every = 1000,
        do_wandb = True,
    )
    
    trainer.train()
    # after a lot of training
    
    sampled_images = diffusion.sample(batch_size = 4)
    sampled_images.shape # (4, 3, 128, 128)
```

Samples and model checkpoints will be logged to `./results_folder` periodically

## Multi-GPU Training

The `Trainer` class is now equipped with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator">ðŸ¤— Accelerator</a>. You can easily do multi-gpu training in two steps using their `accelerate` CLI

At the project root directory, where the training script is, run

```python
$ accelerate config
```

Then, in the same directory

```python
$ accelerate launch train.py
```

## Miscellaneous

### 1D Sequence

By popular request, a 1D Unet + Gaussian Diffusion implementation.

```python
import torch
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet1D, GaussianDiffusion1D, Trainer1D, Dataset1D

model = Unet1D(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    channels = 32
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion1D(
    model,
    seq_length = 128,
    timesteps = 1000,
    objective = 'pred_v'
)

training_seq = torch.rand(64, 32, 128) # features are normalized from 0 to 1

loss = diffusion(training_seq)
loss.backward()

# Or using trainer

dataset = Dataset1D(training_seq)  # this is just an example, but you can formulate your own Dataset and pass it into the `Trainer1D` below

trainer = Trainer1D(
    diffusion,
    dataset = dataset,
    train_batch_size = 32,
    train_lr = 8e-5,
    train_num_steps = 700000,         # total training steps
    gradient_accumulate_every = 2,    # gradient accumulation steps
    ema_decay = 0.995,                # exponential moving average decay
    amp = True,                       # turn on mixed precision
)
trainer.train()

# after a lot of training

sampled_seq = diffusion.sample(batch_size = 4)
sampled_seq.shape # (4, 32, 128)

```

`Trainer1D` does not evaluate the generated samples in any way since the type of data is not known.

You could consider adding a suitable metric to the training loop yourself after doing an editable install of this package
`pip install -e .`.
